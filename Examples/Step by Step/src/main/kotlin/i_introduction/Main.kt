/*
-- Welcome to Project Gunfire --

We will begin by deciding on which gun to use.
Our choices are Gun, Sniper, Revolver and Uzi!

=> Gun
This one is just really simple and has no extensions,
we can use this for testing and single threaded applications.

=> Sniper
This Sniper synchronizes each shot with an internal lock.
We can use this for thread-safety when needed.

=> Revolver
When we want to have parallel bullet shots we can this as it provides up to
6 concurrent worker threads with an Executor.

=> Uzi
This makes use of the coroutines experiment that kotlin 1.1.1 introduced.
It is much more lightweight compared to threads but is executed in sequence, this means
bullets will fire in sequence but the target execution will not block the gun fire thread.

    // Catch every message and print it as a line to System.out
    gun.target<MessageBullet>(::println)

    // Fire the message bullet
    gun.fire { MessageBullet("This was fired by a Gun!") }


    println("-- Switching to Sniper --")
    gun = Sniper()

    gun.target<MessageBullet> {
        println(it.message)
        gun.fire { BlankBullet }
    }

    // When getting a BlankBullet we end transmission!
    gun.target<BlankBullet> { println("End of transmission!") }

        MessageBullet("This is fired with precision!")
